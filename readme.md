## Inspiration
It all started with a trip to Las Vegas. Like most visitors, we expected the usual—bright lights, casinos, and the Strip’s never-ending energy. But one night, a conversation with a longtime resident led us somewhere different: a tucked-away jazz club in the Historic Westside. The atmosphere, the music, and the stories shared there were unlike anything we had experienced in the city’s tourist hotspots.

That moment stuck with us. We realized how much of a city's true culture often goes unnoticed, hidden beneath commercial attractions. What if travelers had easy access to these deeper cultural experiences—insights that usually come from locals, historians, or community elders? That question became the foundation of Vintage ExploreX, a project designed to bring authentic cultural heritage to the forefront in 15 iconic American cities.
